         EP1: First time i saw you.
        </div>
        <div class="none">
          yeah so let's begin... first time i saw you, i saw you first
          inside the campus, i liked your style...i really liked your 
          style because you're so simple, you're easy going and you're
          like loner, or something that is not so friendly. but i really don't
          know your name that time... but after i saw that fb account that
          appeared out of nowhere... i ignored it at first, but as the time
          goes by... i frequently i mean i can always see your account passing
          through my friends suggestions... and i got curious and i have this
          gut feeling that is unexplained and it remains a mystery till now...
          I don't know why, but this gut feeling leads me to send you a friend
          request, idk but i just clicked the add friend button XD, and now...
