          I really don't know how to make a first move to 
          a girl so i did research, and watch some YT videos
          XD yeah imma be honest with you, and i created a 
          message for you some long ass message and then it
          seems like it's too long and that time, I really 
          thought you don't like long messages... so i rephrased
          it and i did it shorter... and it seems like my grammar
          is awful and disgusting, i went to QuillBot website 
          and i asked for grammar correction so it would look
          descent and neat XD and thursday i mean 1am in Friday
          i sent you the message already and i was shocked because
          i wasn't expecting your reaction to be positive! and i
          was so so happy that time...
