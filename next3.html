          forget those memories we've created... i will never,
          ever forget those memories, because you are my core,
          my world, my memories, everything! we are always be
          a strong couple, we over come each of our problems
          and also, even if we argue, it doesn't mean we are
          going to part ways as a couple... no, no, no... that's
          not gonna happen because we're strong and has a huge
          amount of patience...
